###Engineering solutions [to problems in daily life].
- - - -

####Motivation
Lately, I've been addressing a *lot* more issues that arise in my life with arbitrary, specialized and focused engineering processes. This has resulted in <u>various concrete improvements in the efficiency of how I live my life and overcome its obstacles.</u>

This skill came to me naturally, and has always been there, but is just now starting to really begin to blossom as I am engineering more and more solutions within software.

Also, having to meet the demands of clients, whose views and goals differ from my own inceptions, has been a boon to both my software development and the aforementioned skill which is more abstract. It can be made useful in *virtually any situation*.
